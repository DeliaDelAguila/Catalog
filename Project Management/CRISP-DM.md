# CRISP-DM

The **Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining** or CRISP-DM is a process model that provides a framework for defining, building, testing, and deploying machine learning solutions.

This process englobe six main steps:

**1. Business understanding**
 
"Business First", this phase focuses on understanding the project objectives and requirements from a business perspective,
then converting this knowledge into a data mining problem definition and a preliminary plan designed to achieve
the objectives. 

**2. Data understanding**

The objective of this pahse is to collect and become familiar with the data, indentify data quality problems, discover first patterns and insights into the data, and/or detect interesting subsets to form hypotheses regarding hidden information.

**3. Data preparation**

This phase covers all activities needed to construct the "final" dataset from the initial raw data. Data preparation tasks are likely to be performed multiple times and not in any prescribed order. Tasks include table, record, and attribute selection, as well as transformation and cleaning of data for modeling tools.

**4. Modeling**

Here various modeling techniques are selected and applied, and their parameters are calibrated to optimal values. Typically, there are several techniques for the same data mining problem type. Therefore, going back to the data preparation phase is often necessary.

**5. Evaluation**

At this stage in the project, you have built a model (or models) that appears to have high quality from a data analysis perspective. Before proceeding to final deployment of the model, it is important to evaluate it and review the steps executed to create it, to be certain the model properly achieves the **business objectives** and gives accurate results.

**6. Deployment**

Creation of the model is generally not the end of the project. Even if the purpose of the model is to increase knowledge
of the data, the knowledge gained will need to be organized and presented in a way that the customer can use it. It
often involves applying “live” models within an organization’s decision making processes—for example, real-time
personalization of Web pages or repeated scoring of marketing databases. Depending on the requirements, the
deployment phase can be as simple as generating a report or as complex as implementing a repeatable data mining
process across the enterprise. In many cases, it is the **customer, not the data analyst, who carries out the deployment
steps**. However, even if the analyst will carry out the deployment effort, it is important for the customer to understand
up front what actions need to be carried out in order to actually make use of the created models.
