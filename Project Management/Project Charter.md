# Project Charter

The Project Charter formalizes the existence of a project, the main benefit is determined by a well-defined project start and boundaries that support acceptance from top management. For starting a Project Charter we require to define first our Business Case. The following example can be used as a template.

### Project: BI Data Warehouse
**1. The Vision/Problem Statement**

Company tracks millions of user interactions daily to understand user behaviour and build strategies based on this. 
Tool1, Tool2 and Tool3 are web analytics tools which collect different dimensions and metrics about the customer. These tools offer visualization services that simplify basic reporting but it does not offer a robust reporting and analysis tool to handle all the amount of data we are collecting today becoming hard follow metrics that support the daily operation.

PROBLEM: Nowadays a robust report with previous mentioned tools takes an exhausting manual process that requires extensive technical background and requires local storage of data. 

**2. Project Summary**

**2.1 Project Description**

This project covers the creation and governance strategy of a Data Warehouse to store all the data coming from Tool1, Tool2 and Tool3 including the integration to a Visualization tool that will allow users of different technical level to analyze, verify and create reports of all the user interaction data we have collected and which will do in the future. This project will consider technological constraints in order to determine the most acceptable solution, given the high-volume expectations and resources available.

**2.2 Project Benefits & Business Drivers**

The company will be able to: 

* Build reports with a data visualization tool in real time that would provide them insights of the customer behavior using the data we collected today from Tool1, Tool2 and Tool3.

* Manipulate behavioral data to analyze, trends, usage, etc. without having to go through an intensive manual process. 

**2.3 Impact if Not Completed**

The company will be unable to handle the expected volumes of data with the current solution without an extensive manual process.
Analysts will not have the data collected through tools in a usable format in time to make important business decisions.

**3. Project Scope**

**3.1 In Scope**

Create a warehouse database to store the data from tool1, tool2, tool3 that the company needs for KPIs reporting and operational metrics. 
Determine data governance strategy to ensure Availability, Usability, Integrity and Security of the data
Ensure visualization of KPIs and main metrics with a Business Tool and creation of a in-house visualization tool that meets specific company necessities.

**4.1 Delivery Model**

Agile development methodology

| Artifact | Details | Triggers the following |
|----------|---------|------------------------|
| Project Charter (Scope) | Green light project, official agreement to assign resources to project and consensus for stakeholders on scope of project and what the company is aiming to achieve | Detailed requirements definition process |
| EPICs | High level requirements or features which provide enough information for teams to provide estimates on length of project;  this will allow creation of the initial draft “Project Schedule” including major milestones. Senior management and commercial teams require estimates for long term planning purposes. | Creation of Project Schedule | 
| Stories | Provide enough detail for teams to begin “building” or “coding”  (e.g. software engineering, infrastructure). Each story must be completed by the start of each Sprint. | Sprint, software development begins |
