# Recommender Systems
At this section we will learn how to create a Recommender System from scratch at Python.
 To create a good recommender system we need a lot of accurate data, for building it you can use data as rating, consumptions or recurrence based on what you want to recommend (videos, ads, products, people...)

## Step 1: Setting your environment 

1. Install [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) including Python
2. Create a new environment at Anaconda: Environment > Create > Write Name > Choose Python and Save
