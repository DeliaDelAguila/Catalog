# Forecasting

> The most reliable way to forecast the future is to try to understand the present.
> â€”John Naisbitt

A forecast is an estimate of future behaviour based on historical data that helps to increase investor confidence, identify opportunities and risks and understand business growing. This can be apply to different areas such as Finance looking for financial outcomes predictions and Digital Analytics when we try to predict total visitors at the end poor forecasting results in incorrect business decisions and leaves the company unprepared to meet future demands.

A good forecast is based on three components:
* Business Assumptions
* Accurate Data
* Machine Learning

## Steps in the Forecasting Process

### 1. Decide What to Forecast

* **Address the real problem**, remember that we are generating a forecast to answer a question
* **Consider time period to be covered**, collect data at the most detailed level possible and consider when to collect new data. The shorter the interval between forecasts, the better.
* **Decide on units of measure**, weeks, months or years? Dollars or any other currency. Consider all changes market can have before you take this decision.

### 2. Clean Data

* **Missing data**, replace missing data value using a moving average estimate of past data or using any data imputation method.
* **Trading day adjustments**, remember the same month of different years may have more or less working days
* **Outliers or special events**, outliers occur all the time. These are unusually high or low data points associated with special events such as holidays or special promotions. These can distort the data and need to be adjusted. Outliers (or special event) data need to be replaced with a more typical value, but be careful with this step understand the real reason when you decide to remove any value.
* **Identify Data Patterns**
a. Level or horizontal. This is the simplest pattern and exists when data fluctuate around a constant mean. It is the easiest to predict and is common for commodity products such as table salt or toothpaste, in the mature stage of their life cycle.
b. Trend. Trend is present when data exhibit an increasing or decreasing pattern over time. The simplest type of trend is a straight line, or linear trend.
c. Seasonality. Seasonality is any pattern that regularly repeats itself. Most of us think of ice cream sales in the summer or during snow shovels in the winter. However, any pattern that regularly repeats itself is a seasonal pattern such as restaurant sales that peak on the weekend. In this case you do a weekly forecast instead of a daily one
d. Cycles. Cycles are patterns created by economic fluctuations. Examples include recessions, inflation, or even the life cycle of a product. The major distinction between seasonality and cycles is that cycles do not have a predictable or repeating length or magnitude. As a result they are most difficult to predict.
In addition to these patterns, data contain random variation that cannot be predicted. The more random variation in the data, the harder it is to forecast.
